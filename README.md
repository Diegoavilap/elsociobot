# elsociobot
Just a Telegram bot for "academic purposes". Don't take this seriously, it's more a useful joke than a serious bot.

## Prerequisites
There are few things you need have installed to get the bot running:

* **Python 3.x.x**

Then install requirements:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the token on your system for the bot:

``` sh
# On Unix systems
export TELEGRAM_TOKEN='PUT-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE'

# On Windows systems
SET TELEGRAM_TOKEN='PUT-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE'
```

## Usage
The bot usage is easy, just run:

```sh
python bot.py
```

# Built-in bot commands
There are *"helpful"* commands set on the bot.

If you want to **"madrear"** someone:

```
/madrear <name>
```
